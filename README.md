# Web Scraping for Economic Applications

This project demonstrates how to build a web scraping routine in Python to collect structured data from websites. The collected data can be used for economic research.

## 📌 Project Objective

- Automate data extraction from publicly available websites.
- Apply best practices in scripting and documentation.
- Enable reproducible and scalable data workflows in economic research.

## 🔍 What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the automated collection of information from websites using code. It's especially useful in economics to obtain up-to-date, granular data from non-traditional sources such as:

- Prices and inflation monitoring
- Labor market trends (e.g., job postings)
- Real estate or rental market dynamics
- Firm-level data on performance or behavior

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
